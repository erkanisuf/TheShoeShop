**Why i did it?**
<br />
I wanted to create Ecommerce since nowdays almost every company has their own selling website and i feel like every developer should know how to create one ,as the future is all about online sales.  
 I found it both challenging and exciting to get a better
understanding of how the dynamic between front end and the
backend works. Since I have never had experiences before with
backend servers. In this case i used NodeJS , which made the adaptation easier since i use already Js in the front end.I learned a lot about the full-stack ., Got a
knowledge of registrations, logins and tokens and mailings , which can be sometimes very difficult to set up . Implemented a
secure and easy way of payments by using stripe. While creating
the project got understanding of deployment and how difficult it
can be in some cases. For first time I also used Cloud Based
service such as AWS . I used the Bucket of the service to store the
images since the Heroku Hosting doesnâ€™t provide storage.
